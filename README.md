# AI-Image-Generation-
Face Image generation using deep learning model DCGAN  and compared with GAN model.

### Overview
DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) is a class of CNN.In image generation it becomes popular now.The main focus point of DCGAN is Generator and Discriminator introduced in the paper [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) This implementation is tested on [CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) using PyTorch.
